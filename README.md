My personal portfolio page V2.0
 
I've created a personal portfolio page before, however; looking back I wasn't very happy with it. It lacked a clean appearance that would be both efficient and aesthically pleasing. Also, the coding was just a mess. No structure or comments made it feel like a mine-field. 
 
I'm wrapping up my Web Developer Foundations class at Wester Governor's University. I felt that I could produce a better product in both previously stated aspect. I think I completed that goal and I feel proud of my work. I plan to add links in to my projects I create throughout school and my life.
